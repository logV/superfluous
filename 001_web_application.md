where do web apps roam?
=======================

web apps can be found on the internet. they tend to live one per domain, but
sometimes there can be a herd on a subdomain. they eat bytes and make use of javascript,
html and css.

a fast web app can load in under 1s on mobile (if it has content in the first
1kb that displays) but the slowest of them can take tens of seconds.
