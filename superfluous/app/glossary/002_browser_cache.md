beware the browser cache
========================

the browser cache is kind of like a hotel. assets go to rest there, between
page loads.  you can ask the bellhop to get an asset, but if they aren't
there, it's going to take a long time until the bellhop returns with it.

unfortunately, you can only ask the bellhop to retrieve an asset, but not if
the asset is in. since there are only so many bellhops - if you ask for too
many assets, you can't also have the bellhop carry your luggage up the stairs. 

this is why developers don't like the browser cache - because the bellhops will
never answer their questions and can take forever to fetch assets.
